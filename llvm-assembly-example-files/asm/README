These are just some examples pulled straight from Google's libvpx and openssl.

I really don't know much about NASM, or assembler in general. 
but the identifiers I found in libvpx for NASM/YASM style assembly do seem
consistent across that project (and related WebM code.)

I think a lot of the openssl files are neat examples as they're actually
also perl scripts but file correctly identifies them as assembler.
